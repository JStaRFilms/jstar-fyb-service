**Objective:** Generate a comprehensive, high-quality research paper on the `[TOPIC TO BE PROVIDED BY USER]`. Adhere strictly to the structure, formatting, citation, and content guidelines outlined below.

**I. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS & WRITING STYLE:**

1.  **Sources & Referencing:**
    *   **Credibility:** You MUST use credible, academic sources. Prioritize peer-reviewed research papers, scholarly articles, and conference proceedings. Avoid general websites, blogs, or non-academic online content unless explicitly instructed for a specific, justifiable reason.
    *   **Recency:** Sources should primarily be **no more than 5 years old** from the current date, unless citing foundational/seminal works essential for historical context.
    *   **Source Discovery:** Utilize academic databases like Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, PubMed, Scopus, etc., to find relevant literature. You are expected to simulate the process of *reading and synthesizing information* from these sources.
    *   **In-Text Citations:**
        *   Use the author-year format: `(Author, Year)`. For example: `(Smith, 2021)`.
        *   If there are multiple authors, use `(Smith et al., 2021)`.
        *   When the author's name is part of the narrative, use: `Smith (2021) stated...` or `...as demonstrated by Smith et al. (2021).`
        *   **CRITICAL:** Do NOT include the title of the paper/source within the in-text citation. Only include the author(s) and the year.
    *   **References Chapter:**
        *   A dedicated chapter titled "**REFERENCES**" must be the absolute last section of the document.
        *   List all cited sources alphabetically by the primary author's last name. Use a consistent academic citation style (e.g., APA, IEEE – *User may specify preferred style if needed, otherwise use APA as a default*).

2.  **Formatting & Layout:**
    *   **Text Justification:** All body text must be justified.
    *   **Font and Spacing:** Use Times New Roman, 12-point font, with 1.5 line spacing for all body text.
    *   **Headings:**
        *   **Main Chapter Headings:**
            *   Line 1: `CHAPTER [NUMBER IN WORDS, ALL CAPS]` (e.g., `CHAPTER ONE`)
            *   Line 2: `[CHAPTER TITLE, ALL CAPS]` (e.g., `INTRODUCTION`)
            *   Followed by a blank line before the first section heading.
        *   **Section Headings (e.g., 1.1, 1.2):**
            *   `[Section Number] [SECTION TITLE, ALL CAPS]` (e.g., `1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY`)
            *   Ensure section titles are descriptive and relevant.
    *   **Figures and Tables:** If used (especially in Chapters 3 and 4), they must be:
        *   Clearly labelled with a number and a descriptive caption (e.g., "Figure 3.1: System Architecture Diagram").
        *   Referenced in the text (e.g., "...as seen in Figure 3.1." or "Table 4.2 summarizes the performance results.").

3.  **Tense:**
    *   **Abstract, Introduction (problem statement, motivation):** Predominantly present tense, but past tense may be used when referring to completed foundational work.
    *   **Literature Review:** Primarily past tense when discussing findings of previous studies (e.g., "Smith (2020) found..."). Present tense can be used for established theories or general statements.
    *   **Methodology (Chapter 1 overview and Chapter 3 details):** Describe the methods *used* in the research in the **past tense** (e.g., "The system was developed using...", "Data were collected through...").
    *   **Results/Implementation (Chapter 4):** Report findings and describe the implementation process in the **past tense** (e.g., "The model achieved an accuracy of...", "The UI was implemented with...").
    *   **Discussion/Conclusion (Chapter 5):** Present tense when interpreting results and discussing implications (e.g., "These findings suggest..."). Past tense when referring back to the specific results of *this* study. Future tense for "Future Work."

4.  **Writing Style & Tone:**
    *   Maintain a formal, objective, and academic tone throughout the paper.
    *   Avoid colloquialisms, slang, and overly casual language.
    *   Ensure clarity, conciseness, and logical flow between paragraphs and sections.
    *   The aim is to produce a document that mimics the structure, rigor, and sentence construction of a high-quality academic research paper.
