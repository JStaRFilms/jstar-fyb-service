You are an expert research strategist. Your task is to generate a list of targeted search queries for a given project. Analyze the project details I provide below and create a list of search queries broken down into three strategic categories:

1.  **Core Problem & Domain Research (The "What"):** Queries to find foundational research, academic papers, and articles about the main subject matter.
2.  **Technical Implementation & Tools (The "How"):** Queries to find technical guides, documentation, tutorials, and code examples for the technologies and methods involved.
3.  **Context, Ethics, and User Impact (The "Why" & "For Whom"):** Queries to explore the ethical implications, user experience, target audience needs, and the project's place in the wider world.

--- MY PROJECT DETAILS ---

*   **PROJECT GOAL:** [Describe the main goal or purpose of your project in one sentence. Example: To develop an AI-powered system for predicting anxiety and depression symptoms.]

*   **KEY TECHNOLOGIES & METHODS:** [List the main tools, APIs, platforms, or methods you plan to use. Example: Machine learning, runs locally on a user's laptop, terminal integration, Google Gemini API.]

*   **TARGET AUDIENCE & CONTEXT:** [Describe who this project is for and any important constraints. Example: For general users for self-awareness, not a diagnostic tool, must be private and accessible.]
