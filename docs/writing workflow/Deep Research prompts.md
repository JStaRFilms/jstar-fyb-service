We are developing an AI-Powered System for Predicting Anxiety & Depression Symptoms. This system aims to provide users with personalized insights into their potential symptom likelihood by leveraging machine learning models and user-provided data. A key focus is making this technology accessible, requiring the system to run locally on a user's laptop and integrate with the local environment (terminal, file system). We will explore how the Google Gemini API can be integrated, potentially for enhancing data processing, providing contextual information, or explaining prediction outcomes, ensuring the tool serves as a valuable aid for self-awareness and early insight, rather than a diagnostic replacement.


So I want to build "a state-of-the-art general AI agent that connects thoughts and actions. Leveraging advanced LLMs and tool integration, Manus AI delivers superior performance in the GAIA benchmark, making it ideal for automation, productivity, and complex task handling."
What are the things to consider I want to be able to run i ton my laptop ustiizing google gemini api ad also for it to integrate locally with my laptops terminal/cmd, file explorer etc...
