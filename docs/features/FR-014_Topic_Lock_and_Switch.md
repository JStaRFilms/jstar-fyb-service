# FR-014: Topic Lock & Project Switch Rules

## Goal
Implement business rules to prevent account sharing while allowing legitimate topic changes.
This system ensures that:
1.  Users commit to a topic before paying.
2.  Users cannot abuse the system by creating unlimited projects for different people under one account.
3.  Legitimate users (e.g., topic rejected by lecturer) have a path to switch topics either for free (with proof) or for a fee (if changing mind).

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Schema Changes**: This feature introduces a new `isLocked` field on the `Project` model and a new `TopicSwitchRequest` model.
> **Blocking Behavior**: Once a project is paid and locked, users will be **blocked** from creating new projects and from navigating back to the topic selection screen in the builder.

## Proposed Changes

### Database Schema
#### [MODIFY] [schema.prisma](file:///c:/CreativeOS/01_Projects/Code/Personal_Stuff/Final%20Year%20Project%20service/2025-12-15_jstar-fyb-service/prisma/schema.prisma)
- Add `isLocked` (Boolean) and `lockedAt` (DateTime) to `Project` model.
- Create `TopicSwitchRequest` model to track switch requests.

### Backend Logic
#### [MODIFY] [projects.service.ts](file:///c:/CreativeOS/01_Projects/Code/Personal_Stuff/Final%20Year%20Project%20service/2025-12-15_jstar-fyb-service/src/services/projects.service.ts)
- Modify `createProject`: Check if user already has a locked project. If so, throw strict error.
- New method `lockProject(projectId)`: Sets `isLocked = true`. Called after successful payment.

#### [NEW] [topic-switch.service.ts](file:///c:/CreativeOS/01_Projects/Code/Personal_Stuff/Final%20Year%20Project%20service/2025-12-15_jstar-fyb-service/src/services/topic-switch.service.ts)
- `createRequest(userId, projectId, reason, proof?)`
- `reviewRequest(requestId, status, adminId)`
- `processSwitch(projectId)`: Unlocks project.

#### [MODIFY] [billing.service.ts](file:///c:/CreativeOS/01_Projects/Code/Personal_Stuff/Final%20Year%20Project%20service/2025-12-15_jstar-fyb-service/src/services/billing.service.ts)
- In `recordPayment`: Call `projectsService.lockProject(projectId)` immediately after payment success.

### UI Components
#### [MODIFY] [BuilderClient.tsx](file:///c:/CreativeOS/01_Projects/Code/Personal_Stuff/Final%20Year%20Project%20service/2025-12-15_jstar-fyb-service/src/features/builder/components/BuilderClient.tsx)
- Add check: If `project.isLocked`, disable "Back" navigation to previous steps (like topic selection).

#### [NEW] [TopicLockModal.tsx](file:///c:/CreativeOS/01_Projects/Code/Personal_Stuff/Final%20Year%20Project%20service/2025-12-15_jstar-fyb-service/src/features/billing/components/TopicLockModal.tsx)
- Modal component shown before initiating payment.
- Contains warning text and "I understand" checkbox.

#### [NEW] [TopicSwitchRequestForm.tsx](file:///c:/CreativeOS/01_Projects/Code/Personal_Stuff/Final%20Year%20Project%20service/2025-12-15_jstar-fyb-service/src/features/support/components/TopicSwitchRequestForm.tsx)
- Form for user to request switch (Reason dropdown, File upload for proof).

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- **Unit Tests**:
    - Test `createProject` throws if user has locked project.
    - Test `lockProject` updates DB correctly.
    - Test `TopicSwitchRequest` creation.

### Manual Verification
1.  **New User Flow**:
    - Create project -> Select Topic -> Try to Pay.
    - Verify Lock Warning Modal appears.
    - Pay -> Verify Project is `isLocked`.
    - Try to create NEW project -> Expect Error/Block.
2.  **Switch Flow**:
    - Go to Settings/Support.
    - Request Switch (Reason: Lecturer Rejected).
    - Mock Admin Approval.
    - Verify Project is unlocked.
