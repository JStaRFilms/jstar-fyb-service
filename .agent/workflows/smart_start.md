# Workflow: Smart Start (Intelligent)

## Usage
User: "/smart_start I want to work on [description]"

## Steps

### 1. Detect Available Script
Check which script exists:
- If `scripts/smart-ops.ps1` exists AND shell is PowerShell → Use `.ps1`
- If `scripts/smart-ops.sh` exists AND shell is Bash/WSL → Use `.sh`
- If both exist → Auto-detect based on current shell environment

### 2. Scan Work (Scripted)
**PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\scripts\smart-ops.ps1 start
```

**Bash:**
```bash
./scripts/smart-ops.sh start
```

### 3. Analyze User Intent
Match user's intent to existing issue/draft, or create NEW.

**If NEW, strictly use the Professional Issue Template:**
