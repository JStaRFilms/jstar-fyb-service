Okay, so let's take a moment to actually explain what this project is. I've recorded it before but I'm going to record it again. Long story short though, the way things are right now, I feel there's a lot of gap between where I want it to be and where it's at now, especially when you're looking at the project builder. You know like, there's like Jay. Jay is like the guy that helps you out and I feel like Jay is too robotic right now because what I would actually have envisioned is like me coming to ChatGPT and I'm like, oh shit, bro, I don't really know what I'm doing right now, this is who I am, blah, blah, blah. Jay is like, okay, these topics are kind of like too me. Let's try these topics because they're kind of like easier but they sound more complex or let's try this one because it's actually a bit complex but it's something I know that the team will be able to handle, yada, yada, yada. The person goes back and forth and then Jay is like basically pitching this idea to them and telling them why it's good and like they feel so convinced and then when they are ready because Jay is like, okay, so now I need you to give me your name and your WhatsApp number or something like that and then you get the DM and then you're like, okay, sure, I'll do that, boom, and then Jay gives them that and they submit that and then we save it to the database. Either we link it one way or the other or whatever, do that, and then we link it one way or the other and everything is fine. I don't really know how that logic is, either he's signing or whatever it is. Then we move on to the like project builder section and the project builder section for me, what I was really thinking is like, oh, we get there now, the topic from Jay gets passed down into the project builder, which is really cool. The person gets the abstracts from there and then they have like the choice of either doing like a proposal, project proposal plan or just like moving straight into like the making the project itself and then when they get into making the project itself section, they see like a pricing, whatever it is, do you understand that kind of stuff? And I feel like to some extent, if maybe we give them, because like the way it actually really works is this, I feel like when we get this, when you get to that part and maybe we should let them generate chapter one to five, like not even generate it, like, you know, that whole outline where you have like project title, yada, yada, yada, do you understand for chapter one to five? I think we should let them have that. Do you understand what I'm saying? Because that will give them, I don't know, we just need to like put the pricing at a good point where it feels almost stupid to not pay. You understand that kind of thing? Because like now, it's like, oh, project title this year, what about unlock your full project? So because when you unlock your full project and it generates all the whole stuff for chapter one to five or whatever it is, then we now move on to the next thing, which will now be like, oh, um, now, no matter what I've done is that I'll go to notebook LM and in notebook LM, I'll reverse engineer and get sources. So get all the sources needed, maybe like 10, 11. And then after that, I have prompts that we'll be using exactly as they are. So one of the prompts, what he basically does is, is going to extract the paper title, author, publication year, objective, motivation, methodology, contribution, and limitations of each of these projects. Do you understand what I'm saying? So probably have like an area where I can upload PDFs and then one by one, like a Gemini movie. I'll just go through it and read all the PDFs and get all this information out of all of them. So that this way, it'll be easier for when we're parsing it down the line, when creating the project itself, then you have like research paper generation prompts that I have that breaks down chapter one, chapter two, chapter three, chapter four, and everything like that. And so like this, like the human in the loop where it's like me, I'll be the one that'll do all this stuff. And then a person communicates with me either through WhatsApp or whatever it is, or through the application really. Like, do you understand what I'm saying? And then they just see that, oh, okay, your project outline is updated or this is updated based on whatever I do from my own end as like from the other side of the whole thing. You understand that kind of thing. And then it's going down and down and down and down. And that's like literally what the plan is, honestly. That's literally what the plan is. It's like, and I feel like we're far from that. I feel like we're far from that, but yeah. So yeah. So what do you think, looking at the present plan, what do you think needs to be tweaked so that we can have like a written down plan and we can move on from there properly?
